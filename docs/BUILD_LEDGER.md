## 2026-03-20 02:00 CT - [FIX] Complete schema stabilization and alignment
- Summary: Performed comprehensive schema alignment to match live Supabase database, removing all references to non-existent fields and implementing validation guards to prevent undefined UUID errors
- Files changed:
  - `src/types/database.types.ts` - Reduced PPAPRecord to 9 minimal safe fields, removed deleted_at from all interfaces
  - `src/features/ppap/queries.ts` - Removed deleted_at filters, added ID validation guards, removed mold_required from stats
  - `src/features/ppap/mutations.ts` - Removed softDeletePPAP, added ID validation, added data.id guard before event logging
  - `src/features/tasks/mutations.ts` - Removed deleted_at filter, removed softDeleteTask, added ppapId validation
  - `src/features/documents/mutations.ts` - Removed deleted_at filter, removed softDeleteDocument, added ppapId validation
  - `src/features/conversations/mutations.ts` - Removed deleted_at filter, added ppapId validation
  - `src/features/events/mutations.ts` - Added ppap_id and ppapId validation guards
  - `src/features/ppap/components/PPAPHeader.tsx` - Removed references to due_date, mold_required, part_name, assigned_to, assigned_role, submission_level
  - `src/features/ppap/components/PPAPListTable.tsx` - Removed assigned_to, due_date, mold_required columns
  - `src/features/ppap/components/MoldSection.tsx` - Replaced with safe placeholder returning null
  - `src/features/ppap/components/CreatePPAPForm.tsx` - Reduced to 4 required fields only
  - `app/ppap/[id]/page.tsx` - Removed MoldSection usage, added ID validation guard
  - `app/page.tsx` - Replaced JSON.stringify debug output with clean table UI
- Database changes: None (aligned code to existing minimal schema)
- Decisions made:
  - Use minimal stable schema (9 fields) for PPAPRecord
  - Remove soft delete pattern entirely (no deleted_at)
  - Validate all IDs before database queries
  - Guard event logging to require valid ppap_id
  - Remove all optional fields until system is stable
- Risks / follow-ups:
  - Optional fields (mold, assignment, dates) can be reintroduced one at a time after stability confirmed
  - AssignmentControl and MoldSection components exist but not used
  - Need to verify Vercel build passes with all changes
- Verification:
  - No deleted_at references remain in codebase
  - All query functions validate IDs before use
  - Dashboard displays table instead of JSON
  - TypeScript types match minimal schema
  - No references to removed fields in active UI
- Commit: `fix: align schema with live database and add ID validation guards`

## 2026-03-19 14:30 CT - [FEAT] Complete MVP vertical slice implementation
- Summary: Built complete end-to-end PPAP operations module with list, create, and dashboard pages, plus all supporting data access layer and UI components
- Files changed:
  - `app/ppap/page.tsx` (created) - PPAP list page
  - `app/ppap/new/page.tsx` (created) - Create PPAP form page
  - `app/ppap/[id]/page.tsx` (created) - PPAP dashboard page
  - `src/features/ppap/queries.ts` (created) - Data fetching functions
  - `src/features/ppap/mutations.ts` (created) - Data mutation functions
  - `src/features/ppap/components/PPAPListTable.tsx` (created)
  - `src/features/ppap/components/CreatePPAPForm.tsx` (created)
  - `src/features/ppap/components/PPAPHeader.tsx` (created)
  - `src/features/ppap/components/MoldSection.tsx` (created)
  - `src/features/conversations/mutations.ts` (created)
  - `src/features/conversations/components/ConversationList.tsx` (created)

  - `src/features/events/components/EventHistory.tsx` (created)
  - `src/lib/utils.ts` (created) - Date formatting and utility functions
  - `src/types/database.types.ts` (created) - TypeScript interfaces for all entities
  - `supabase/schema.sql` (created) - Complete database schema
  - `README.md` (updated) - Comprehensive setup and usage instructions
  - `ENV_TEMPLATE.md` (created) - Environment variable setup guide
- Database changes: Complete schema defined for all 5 tables (ppap_records, ppap_documents, ppap_conversations, ppap_tasks, ppap_events)
- Decisions made: 
  - Feature-based folder structure for maintainability
  - Separate queries and mutations files per feature
  - Client components for interactivity, server components for data fetching
  - Event logging integrated into all mutations
- Risks / follow-ups:
  - User needs to manually create .env.local file (cannot be auto-created due to .gitignore)
  - Database tables must be created in Supabase before app will work
  - No interactive forms for adding conversations/tasks/documents yet (read-only display)
  - Status change and assignment features not yet implemented (coming next)
- Verification: All TypeScript files compile without errors, folder structure matches BUILD_PLAN
- Commit: `feat: implement complete PPAP MVP with list, create, and dashboard pages`
